/*
 GET    statuses/show/:id
 
 Returns a single Tweet, specified by the id parameter. The Tweet's author will also be embedded within the tweet.
 
 See Embeddable Timelines, Embeddable Tweets, and GET statuses/oembed for tools to render Tweets according to Display Requirements.
 
 # About Geo
 
 If there is no geotag for a status, then there will be an empty <geo/> or "geo" : {}. This can only be populated if the user has used the Geotagging API to send a statuses/update.
 
 The JSON response mostly uses conventions laid out in GeoJSON. Unfortunately, the coordinates that Twitter renders are reversed from the GeoJSON specification (GeoJSON specifies a longitude then a latitude, whereas we are currently representing it as a latitude then a longitude). Our JSON renders as: "geo": { "type":"Point", "coordinates":[37.78029, -122.39697] }
 
 # Contributors
 
 If there are no contributors for a Tweet, then there will be an empty or "contributors" : {}. This field will only be populated if the user has contributors enabled on his or her account -- this is a beta feature that is not yet generally available to all.
 
 This object contains an array of user IDs for users who have contributed to this status (an example of a status that has been contributed to is this one). In practice, there is usually only one ID in this array. The JSON renders as such "contributors":[8285392].

/*
 POST	statuses/update
 
 Updates the authenticating user's current status, also known as tweeting. To upload an image to accompany the tweet, use POST statuses/update_with_media.
 
 For each update attempt, the update text is compared with the authenticating user's recent tweets. Any attempt that would result in duplication will be blocked, resulting in a 403 error. Therefore, a user cannot submit the same status twice in a row.
 
 While not rate limited by the API a user is limited in the number of tweets they can create at a time. If the number of updates posted by the user reaches the current allowed limit this method will return an HTTP 403 error.
 
 - Any geo-tagging parameters in the update will be ignored if geo_enabled for the user is false (this is the default setting for all users unless the user has enabled geolocation in their settings)
 - The number of digits passed the decimal separator passed to lat, up to 8, will be tracked so that the lat is returned in a status object it will have the same number of digits after the decimal separator.
 - Please make sure to use to use a decimal point as the separator (and not the decimal comma) for the latitude and the longitude - usage of the decimal comma will cause the geo-tagged portion of the status update to be dropped.
 - For JSON, the response mostly uses conventions described in GeoJSON. Unfortunately, the geo object has coordinates that Twitter renderers are reversed from the GeoJSON specification (GeoJSON specifies a longitude then a latitude, whereas we are currently representing it as a latitude then a longitude. Our JSON renders as: "geo": { "type":"Point", "coordinates":[37.78217, -122.40062] }
 - The coordinates object is replacing the geo object (no deprecation date has been set for the geo object yet) -- the difference is that the coordinates object, in JSON, is now rendered correctly in GeoJSON.
 - If a place_id is passed into the status update, then that place will be attached to the status. If no place_id was explicitly provided, but latitude and longitude are, we attempt to implicitly provide a place by calling geo/reverse_geocode.
 - Users will have the ability, from their settings page, to remove all the geotags from all their tweets en masse. Currently we are not doing any automatic scrubbing nor providing a method to remove geotags from individual tweets.

 POST	statuses/retweet/:id
 
 Retweets a tweet. Returns the original tweet with retweet details embedded.

 - Twitter will ignore attempts to perform duplicate retweets.
 - The retweet_count will be current as of when the payload is generated and may not reflect the exact count. It is intended as an approximation.

 POST	statuses/update_with_media
 
 Updates the authenticating user's current status and attaches media for upload. In other words, it creates a Tweet with a picture attached.
 
 Unlike POST statuses/update, this method expects raw multipart data. Your POST request's Content-Type should be set to multipart/form-data with the media[] parameter
 
 The Tweet text will be rewritten to include the media URL(s), which will reduce the number of characters allowed in the Tweet text. If the URL(s) cannot be appended without text truncation, the tweet will be rejected and this method will return an HTTP 403 error.
